# Perceptron Supervised Learning

This repository contains the practical project **"Supervised Learning with the Perceptron Neuron"**, developed for the **Artificial Neural Networks** course (2025.2) at **Universidade do Estado do Amazonas (UEA)**.  

The objective is to implement Rosenblatt's Perceptron training algorithm in Python, applying it to classification problems using supervised learning. The project is divided into three main parts:

## 📚 Project Structure

### Part I – Linearly Separable Problem
- Training the Perceptron with dataset `dataAll.txt`.
- Using step activation function (ϑ = 0).
- Learning rate: η = 0.1.
- Weights initialized randomly from U(−0.5, +0.5).
- Algorithm runs until convergence (no classification errors).
- Outputs:
  - Number of weight adjustments.
  - Number of epochs until convergence.
  - Scatter plot with decision boundary.

### Part II – Experimentation
- Training repeated 10 times for 6 different configurations:
  - η ∈ {0.4, 0.1, 0.01}.
  - Initial weights ∈ {U(−100, +100), U(−0.5, +0.5)}.
- For each configuration:
  - Mean and standard deviation of weight adjustments.
  - Minimum epochs to converge.
- Results presented in a comparative table (using `prettytable`).

### Part III – Holdout Validation (Non-Linearly Separable Problem)
- Dataset: `dataHoldout.txt`.
- Data split: 70% training / 30% testing.
- Training Perceptron with 100 epochs (weights initialized in U(−0.5, +0.5)).
- Evaluation metrics (using `sklearn.metrics`):
  - Confusion matrix
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, and F-Score
- Scatter plots:
  - Training data with decision boundary
  - Test data with decision boundary
